<h3 id="india" align="center">For those of you who don't know, I went to home town Hyderabad, India this summer. It was the first time my family went back to the hometown in 8 years.
And I can say that single 3 week trip changed my life. I learned so much about what life was like for my parents when they were kids. I got to learn how hard they
worked in order to get to America as well as what hardships they had to deal with, living in a developing community. </h3>
